# the starting point

## premises

This is a blank Quartz installation, by default.
See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started and go further.

**Better yet, in bold**, but *also in italics* see the [Quartz manual](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). Oops, is the same thing...

## going on

I am now creating the Obsidian vault. These simple lines I am writing in MS Visual Code, and enjoy this #start .

## testing configuration exclusions

Let's create [one private test](private/private-test.md).

### this is the heading 3 style

just for calibrating

# place for all experiments

## anacrusis

I installed Git on my phone and I am thrilled by this opportunity. I can't remember where I stopped with this vault experiment, but I am curious if I can also publish this. 

## collaboration

I am thinking about a simple synchronization method that some of my students could use. Dropbox, MS One...,pCloud or Google Drive could represent some options. I could when play with Synology, but that would mean to keep it working full time.
